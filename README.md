# PyBer_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
V.Isualize has tasked with me with creating an analysis demonstrating ridesharing data at PyBer. V.Isualize wants to know the total number of rides, drivers, and fares by city type. This analysis will provide data on the average fare per ride and driver by city type, it will also include a plot for the total fare amounts by month in 2019 for each city type. 
## Results
Urban cities had the most total rides, drivers, and fares. They also had the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest fare for the drivers. Rural cities had the lowest # of rides, drivers, and total fares, but had the highest average fares per ride and driver. The difference we see between the Rural and Urban cities is not unsual given the basic laws of supply and demand, where in the urban cities there are more riders and drivers we would expect to see a lower rate for fares, as opposed to urban cities where there a fewer riders and drivers fares are higher.   

Urban Cities had  1625 total rides, with 2405 drivers and reported roughly $40,000 in total fares resulting in $24.53 per ride and an avergae fare per driver of $16.57.

Suburan cities had 625 total rides across 490 drivers with a total just of just over $19,000 in fares. Avg fare per ride came out to $30.97 and an average fare per driver of $39.50.

Rural cities had 125 total rides across 78 drivers fares totaled $4,327. The average per ride was $34.62 and average fare per driver came out to $55.49.

In our analysis of ride sharing data from Jan 2019 to May 2019 we plotted rural, suburban, and urban ride sharing fares is USD$. Urban cities had the highest dollar amount of fares, suburban came in at second, and rural came in third. We do see a similarity acorss the three types of cities in terms of total fares in dollars all spiking around the last week of Feburaury. However the ranking for total dollar amounts in fares remains the same. 

Urban cities worst performance came in the first week of January but steadily trended up over the course of the data we looked at. Suburban cities remained fairly consistent with weekly earnings ranging between roughly $750 - $1250. 

Rural cities had no weekly earnings that were higher than $500. There are several weeks in January and February where almost no fares were collected.

## Summary
1) In the urban cities there are more drivers than rides, this is leading to increased competion and in turn is creating a scenario where there is a significantly higher average fare per ride than average fare per driver. 
3) Suburban and rural cities have less drivers than total rides so it would be a good decsion to move some urban drivers to the rural and suburban cities to help offset this problem. 
4) Urban cities have the largest amount of rides, but average the lowest fares per ride. You coudl implement two strategies to help alleviate this issue, number you can raise rates in Urban cities and number 2 you could decrease the number of drivers or stop hiring new ones to help balance out the numbers of rides to drivers.  
5) Rural cities have the least total rides and the highest average fare. Two things concern me about this statistic, one it tells me that people leaving in rural cities don't use ride sharing often and two it tells me that pursuing ride sharing in rural cities may not be fruitful when taking into account the other costs assoicated with doing business in these rural areas. To help alleviate this issue I would recomend further cutting the number of drivers and increasing the prices of Rural fares, so that each fare is more profitable and so that you don't have to cover the assoicated costs of having in active drivers in Rural areas.
